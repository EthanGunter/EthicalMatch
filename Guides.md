### Purpose
Guides are written as a means of quickly onboarding new members. The goal is to be as digestible as possible to new eyes. There is no boilerplate within; if it's written down, it's *important*.
In this vein, monolithic documents are broken up into smaller documents with a single focus, addressing only what's relevant to that topic. Inside, if there is too much to address in one place, you will find hyperlinks directing you further down the rabbit hole.
