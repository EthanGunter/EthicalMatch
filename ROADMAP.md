# ROADMAP
This document lays out the stages of *planned* development for EthicalMatch. It should give you a good idea of where the project is at, where it's going, and what features are being prioritized.  
If you're looking for something to work on, features higher up in the list are less likely to be blocked, and available to begin development.

# Phase 1: In the Beginning
