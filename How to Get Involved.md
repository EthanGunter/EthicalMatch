### [[Legal]]
As we challenge the status quo in the online dating world, We anticipate **legal challenges**, especially from corporations like Match Group, Inc. as they seek to protect their investments from a new competitor. To safeguard **EthicalMatch**, we need legal experts who can **anticipate, defend against, and proactively address** the following:
- **Intellectual Property**: Protect our open-source project from infringement claims or attempts to block the use of our technology.
- **Nonprofit Status**: Ensure **EthicalMatch** remains a not-for-profit project, navigating the legal requirements for nonprofit organizations.
- **Data Privacy**: Ensure the platform complies with privacy laws (like GDPR and CCPA), safeguarding user data and ensuring we maintain the highest ethical standards.
- **Corporate Defense**: Defend against attacks from industry giants who may attempt to use lawsuits or influence to undermine our mission.
