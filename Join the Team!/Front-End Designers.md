# EthicalMatch UI/UX Designer Onboarding
As a designer, you play a vital role in shaping the look and feel of our platform. This guide will help you contribute effectively and ensure your designs seamlessly integrate with our development process.

## Recommended Tools for Collaborative Design
Here are some tools we recommend for creating and sharing designs:  
- **Figma**: Collaborative interface design with real-time editing.  
- PenPot: Free and opensource Figma alternative

You can use any tool you're comfortable with, but ensure exported images meet our documentation standards (e.g., PNG or SVG formats for visuals).

## Expectations for Design Contributions

To make your designs maximally useful for front-end developers:  

### General Guidelines
- **Clarity**: Ensure your designs are easy to interpret and annotated where necessary.  
- **Accessibility**: Prioritize accessibility in layouts and interactions (e.g., contrast ratios, keyboard navigation).  
- **Responsiveness**: Consider how your design adapts across devices and screen sizes.  

### What to Include
1. **Wireframes or Mockups**  
   - Clearly depict layouts and component positions.  
   - Show variations for different screen sizes if applicable.  

1. **Annotations**  
   - Highlight interactive elements and their behaviors (e.g., hover states, transitions).  
   - Specify accessibility considerations.  

1. **Visual Examples**  
   - Provide examples of states (e.g., empty vs. filled forms, error messages).  

### File Organization
- Export images in **PNG** or **SVG** format.  
- Save files in the `/designs` folder of the draft branch. Name files descriptively (e.g., `homepage-wireframe.png`).

### Embedding Images in Documentation
To embed an image in Markdown, use the following format:  
```markdown
