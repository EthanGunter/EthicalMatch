# How to Get Involved with Marketing and Outreach
#todo This platform can only succeed if people know about it. We need individuals with **marketing, social media, and community-building** skills to get the word out and maintain an engaged, informed user base.
Our current need is attracting developers and team members. Later we will get into getting publicity for the app itself.
- We probably want some reddit-evangelists to run through relevant subreddits like r/dating and r/onlinedating to find some passionate individuals who are unhappy with the current state of online dating. I imagine there's a big overlap between programmers and people who use online dating apps but don't like them
- **[FUTURE] Content Creation**: Write blog posts, tutorials, and updates that inform our community about new features, the state of the online dating industry, and **EthicalMatch**'s progress.
- **[FUTURE] Social Media Management**: Help manage our online presence, foster conversations about **EthicalMatch**, and spread our message across various platforms (Twitter, Instagram, Reddit, etc.).
