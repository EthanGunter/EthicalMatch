# Onboarding for UI/UX Designers
As a UI and/or UX designer, you fill the essential first step in making new ideas a reality. No front-end feature begins implementation without designer input. Whether it's designing intuitive user flows or crafting layouts and styling, your designs ensure that every feature aligns with our vision of accessibility, usability, and user-centered innovation.

# Your Workflow
1. Find an Issue
1. Collaborate
1. Create Visual Designs
1. Submit And Refine
1. Handoff To Developers

## Find a UI/UX Issue
When a feature request issue is created, if it is determined to need some form of design work, it will be labeled with `UI/UX Design`. Most GitHub Issues opened with the `Src: front-end` label will also have the `UI/UX Design` label.  
To find a GitHub issue in need of design work. You can filter for these issues in the [issues](https://github.com/Ethical-Commons-Project/EthicalMatch/issues) search bar with `label:"UI/UX design"`, or use the [Feature Development Project](https://github.com/orgs/Ethical-Commons-Project/projects/2/views/8) to see an up-to-date list
> [!Note]
> GitHub issues labeled #`UI/UX design` will be blocked from working until *some* form of visual documentation is provided to guide the implementation
## Collaborate
- Review the GitHub issue's description and read through the comments to get an understanding of what is being requested
- Use the discussion thread to ask questions and brainstorm with the team
## Create Visual Designs
- Use tools like Figma, Adobe XD, or Sketch to design user flows, layouts, or styling.
- Ensure your designs follow EthicalMatch’s principles: accessible, clean, and user-focused.

## Submit And Refine

- Attach your designs to the GitHub issue and share exportable links or files for feedback.
- Refine your work based on team input to finalize the design.

## Handoff To Developers

- Provide developers with necessary assets (e.g., SVGs, color palettes, font specs).
- Collaborate during implementation to resolve edge cases or ensure fidelity to the design.

## How To Find the Best Task to Work On

To choose the most impactful work:

1. **Browse the UI/UX Label**  
    Check the **`UI/UX-design`** label on GitHub Issues for tasks needing design input.
    
1. **Focus on High-Priority Features**
    
    - Look for issues tied to roadmap phases (e.g., Phase 1 tasks) or those impacting critical user flows.
    - Tasks related to accessibility improvements often have significant impact.
1. **Ask for Guidance**
    
    - Join our communication platform (Slack/Discord/etc.) and introduce yourself.
    - Project leads and contributors are here to help you get started.
1. **Start with Smaller Tasks**
    
    - New to EthicalMatch? **Good First Issues** are a great way to learn our workflow and style.

## Why Your Work Matters

Features won’t receive the **`#Status: Accepted`** label—needed for developers to begin work—without your designs. Whether it’s a wireframe, a user flow, or a styled mockup, your work is foundational to making EthicalMatch’s vision a reality.
