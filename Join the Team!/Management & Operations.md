# How to Get Involved with Management and Operations
#todo Since EthicalMatch is a non-profit open-source project, we're more interested in setting up systems that allow people to participate at their own pace, while still maintaining an effective forward momentum. Your role on the management and operations team is to devise and setup systems that enable this line of thinking, without active person-to-person management. It's a new way of thinking, but our structure needs to
- Provide a clear set of things to be done, in a prioritized manner
- Provide an easy avenue for new members to get into the groove of picking up and completing work, with as little friction as possible
- Anticipate and accommodate large fluctuations in participating team members

This isn't to eliminate the inter-personal aspects of building something together, rather an acknowledgment of the transient nature of open-source projects. Things happen, people come, and people go. We don't want the project to grind to a halt because we lost a few people whose habits and knowledge we became reliant on.

## Project Management Tool Options
#todo
Currently, there is no established or public means of tracking tasks. This is a vital missing link for people looking for a place to start, and for team members to communicate their progress and commitments to the public. I'm looking into options, and the most promising so far are:
#### Task Tracking
1. Simply GitHub Issues. This obviously works for code issues, but it works well for documentation to-dos as well. Most importantly, it provides a collection of taggable, assignable, and queryable tasks.
#### Road Mapping & Planning
1. **Gantt/Flow mermaid diagrams**
	pros:
	- Built in to the git-workflow
	- Looks way better than plain text
	cons:
	- The syntax is another thing to learn, and there aren't any good interactive editors
		- [This](https://www.mermaidflow.app/editor) one might fit the bill eventually, but it currently only supports flow chart editingâ€¦
	- Might render weird
1. **Plain Text**
	pros: 
	- It works. Ordered lists, should be enough to show priority
	- Requires no new learning. 
	cons:
	- How to demonstrate prerequisites?
	- Lots of text is *ugly* and reading fatigue could cause important things to be missed
#### Everything?
1. [Taiga](https://taiga.io/). Free and open-source, means it can be self hosted, will remain free forever, and is available for pull requests/forks.>)
