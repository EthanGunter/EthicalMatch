# EthicalMatch: Fixing Online Dating

## Introduction
#todo *use more relevant statistics*
In recent years, online dating has become the primary way people meet new romantic partners. According to a 2023 study by Pew Research, **over 30% of adults** in the U.S. have used a dating site or app, with the numbers growing each year. While the digital shift has made dating more accessible, it has also led to a disturbing trend: **the monetization of human connection**. The promise of finding love and companionship has been reduced to a business model designed to **maximize profit** rather than facilitate meaningful relationships. **EthicalMatch** is removing the monetary conflict so we can focus on non-predatory solutions for human connection in a digital age.

### The Problem with Profit-Driven Dating Platforms
Most dating platforms present a façade of helping you meet your perfect match, but thrive on predatory tactics like paywalls, subscription models, and algorithmic manipulation to keep you ***paying for hope***.
1. **High-Quality Matches Behind Paywalls**: Users often encounter pay-to-message, pay-to-boost, or pay-to-see features, creating financial barriers to connection. High-quality matches are frequently hidden behind these tactics.
2. **Incentive to Keep You Searching**: Dating platforms are incentivized to **prolong your search** for a meaningful relationship. After all, if you find someone, you'll cancel your subscription. The business model favors keeping you hooked rather than pairing you with someone compatible.    
3. **Data Monetization**: Many platforms mine user data, not only for "better" matches but also for **advertising and data sales**, eroding user privacy for financial gain.    
4. **Psychological Manipulation**: Features like limited swipes, superficial profiles, and curated experiences **exploit human psychology**, turning dating into a game-like experience that rarely delivers real connections.    

## A Not-for-Profit Solution: EthicalMatch
**EthicalMatch** is an open-source, donation-based, not-for-profit dating platform. Our goal is simple: **to help people find meaningful relationships without financial exploitation**. There are no hidden fees, no endless subscriptions, and no data monetization. All contributions go directly to maintaining the platform, not into corporate pockets.

EthicalMatch isn’t just another dating app; it’s a movement to bring integrity back to internet-facilitated human connection. By providing an open-source, fully-featured dating platform, we aim to create a new standard of transparency and ethical responsibility in the industry. Our mission is to remove the financial barriers between people and meaningful relationships.
**Together, we can shift the paradigm** of what dating platforms should be: tools that facilitate love, not exploit loneliness.

- **Open-source and transparent**: Community-driven and fully auditable.
- **Privacy first**: No selling of user data. Your information stays yours.
