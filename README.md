# EthicalMatch Documentation
This text-only repository is the one-stop-shop for all things EthicalMatch. Whether it be documentation on how the code works, documents detailing business practices, or guides for getting onboarded as a new member; if it's important to EthicalMatch, it's in here.

# What is EthicalMatch?
**EthicalMatch** is an experimental open-source dating platform that takes advantage of it's not-for-profit status to foster meaningful relationships without financial exploitation. Free from profit-driven requirements, **EthicalMatch** can steer clear of predatory monetization practices and focus instead on **privacy**, **transparency**, and ***ethical* matchmaking**.

## Why Make Another Dating App?
This isn’t just about dating—it’s about reclaiming the digital space for the people.

**EthicalMatch** is the first step in a larger mission: the [**Ethical Commons Project**](https://ethical-commons-project.github.io/). This is an initiative to put the power of social platforms back in the hands of its users, in a way that only open-sourced organizations free from financial agendas can.

### The EthicalMatch Solution:
- **Free for Everyone**: Your money will *never* affect your matches. Period.
- **Privacy First**: Each piece of your data is *opt-in*, and clearly explained.
- **Open-Source & Transparent**: Fully open-source decision making and source code. We. Hide. Nothing.
- **Matchmaking with Integrity**: Our goal is quality relationships, not time-on-screen.
