# EthicalMatch: Fixing Online Dating
**EthicalMatch** is a non-predatory, non-profit dating platform designed to foster meaningful relationships without financial exploitation. Unlike profit-driven apps, EthicalMatch eliminates paywalls, subscriptions, and data monetization, focusing instead on **privacy**, **transparency**, and ***ethical* matchmaking**.

## Why Make Another Dating App?

This isn’t just about dating—it’s about reclaiming the digital space for the people.

In a world where the majority of our social lives take place online, the platforms that shape our interactions wield immense power over our sense of purpose, community, and belonging. Instead of fostering connection, many platforms amplify **isolation**, **anxiety**, and **division**—driven by algorithms optimized for engagement and profit, not human well-being.

**EthicalMatch** is the first step in a larger mission: the **Ethical Commons Project**. This initiative is an experiment to see if an open-source, non-profit organization can empower society to build tools for humanity, free from the influence of corporate and investor agendas.

We believe:

- **The digital age should foster humanity**: Platforms must prioritize relationships, happiness, and community over metrics like time-on-screen.
- **Transparency and ethics are non-negotiable**: No hidden fees, no data sales, no manipulative algorithms.
- **People deserve better**: By removing profit as a motivator, we can create technology that genuinely serves the public good.

EthicalMatch is proof of concept. It’s not just a dating app—it’s a movement to take back control over the systems that shape our digital lives. Together, we can build platforms that reflect our humanity, not exploit it.
### The EthicalMatch solution:
- **Free for Everyone**: No pay-to-match mechanics. No financial exploitation. Period.
