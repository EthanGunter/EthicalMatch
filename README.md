# What is EthicalMatch?
*EthicalMatch* is an experimental open-source dating platform that takes advantage of it's not-for-profit status to foster meaningful relationships without financial exploitation. Free from profit-driven requirements, *EthicalMatch* can steer clear of predatory monetization practices and focus instead on **privacy**, **transparency**, and ***ethical* matchmaking**.

## Why Make Another Dating App?
This isn’t just about dating — it’s about reclaiming the internet for the people.  
In an era when a majority of our lives are conducted online, it's unacceptable for corporations with profit-first incentives to freely exploit that human right without accountability.  
*EthicalMatch* is a first step to show people that their digital life can be free from the corporate greed that we've resigned ourselves to expect.  

### The EthicalMatch Solution:
- **Not-for-profit**: By definition, our guiding principles *can't* be derailed by investor demands
- **Open-Source & Transparent**: Fully open-source decision making and source code. We. Hide. Nothing.
- **Matchmaking with Integrity**: Our goal is quality relationships, not months-subscribed.
- **Free for Everyone**: Money will *never* affect your matches. Period.
